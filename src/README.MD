this read me for somebody who will use this pp system at own server. if you wanna change pp system for vn use src/osu folder in pp.rs youll find everything you need
else use same forlder but add "if self.mods.rx()", same logic for ap, hd, and all mods here. dont forget to change system in src/osu_2019 forlder but without "if self.mods.rx()".
when you will change system try not to change src/osu_2019_2 folder
also you can change patterns pp value in src/osu_2019/skill_kind.rs.

thats all you need to know to not brake your prodatction with our pp system. good luck :heart:
